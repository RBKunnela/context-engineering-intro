name: "Documentation Enhancement PRP"
description: |

## Purpose
Enhance and extend the Context Engineering documentation to provide comprehensive guidance, best practices, troubleshooting, and advanced usage patterns for users and AI assistants.

## Core Principles
1. **Context is King**: Include ALL necessary documentation, examples, and caveats
2. **Validation Loops**: Provide executable tests/lints the AI can run and fix
3. **Information Dense**: Use keywords and patterns from the codebase
4. **Progressive Success**: Start simple, validate, then enhance
5. **Global rules**: Be sure to follow all rules in CLAUDE.md

# Task 2 - getting-started.md
# Getting Started with Context Engineering

Welcome! This guide will walk you through creating your first successful Context Engineering implementation in under 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites
- Claude Code installed
- Basic Python knowledge
- A feature you want to build

## Step 1: Understanding the System

Context Engineering has three main components:

1. **INITIAL.md** - Your feature request
2. **PRP** - The implementation blueprint
3. **Execution** - Automated implementation with validation

Think of it like this:
- INITIAL.md is your "what I want"
- PRP is the "detailed plan"
- Execution is the "make it happen"

## Step 2: Your First Feature Request

Let's build a real feature - a password strength checker CLI tool.

### 2.1 Create Your INITIAL.md

```markdown
FEATURE: 
Build a CLI tool that checks password strength with the following features:
- Check password against common patterns
- Provide strength score (0-100)
- Give specific improvement suggestions
- Support batch checking from file
- Output results in JSON or human-readable format

EXAMPLES:
- examples/cli/basic_cli.py - Follow this CLI structure
- examples/testing/test_patterns.py - Use these test patterns

DOCUMENTATION:
- https://pypi.org/project/password-strength/ - Can use this library
- https://github.com/dwyl/english-words - Common words list

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Should work offline (no API calls)
- Performance matters for batch checking
- Clear, actionable feedback for users
- Should handle Unicode passwords
```

### 2.2 Key Points
- **Be Specific**: "password strength checker" vs "security tool"
- **Reference Examples**: Point to patterns to follow
- **Include Docs**: External resources save research time
- **State Constraints**: Offline, performance, etc.

# Task 3 - best-practices.md
# Context Engineering Best Practices

## 1. Writing Effective INITIAL.md Files

### üéØ The Golden Rule
**Specificity beats brevity.** The more context you provide, the better the implementation.

### Structure for Success

#### FEATURE Section
```markdown
‚ùå Bad:
FEATURE: Build a web scraper

‚úÖ Good:
FEATURE: Build an async web scraper that:
- Extracts product data (name, price, description, images)
- Handles pagination automatically
- Respects robots.txt and rate limits
- Saves data to PostgreSQL database
- Provides progress updates via websocket
```

#### EXAMPLES Section
```markdown
‚ùå Bad:
EXAMPLES: Use the examples folder

‚úÖ Good:
EXAMPLES:
- examples/integrations/api_client.py - Use this retry pattern
- examples/agents/simple_agent.py - Follow this async structure
- examples/testing/fixtures.py - Use these test fixtures
```

### 2. Maximizing PRP Quality

#### Research Depth
The `/generate-prp` command researches your codebase. Help it by:

1. **Organizing Examples**: Group related patterns
2. **Clear Naming**: `auth_oauth_flow.py` not `auth2.py`
3. **Documentation**: Include README in examples/

#### Documentation Gathering
```yaml
GOOD Documentation Reference:
- url: https://docs.service.com/api/v2/auth
  why: Need OAuth2 flow specifically
  
- file: internal_docs/api_patterns.md
  why: Company standard for API integration
```

# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. PRP Generation Failures

#### Issue: "Could not find relevant patterns"
**Symptoms**: 
- PRP generation produces minimal context
- Confidence score below 7

**Solution**:
1. Add more examples to `examples/` folder
2. Make INITIAL.md more specific
3. Include direct file references

```markdown
# Add to INITIAL.md
EXAMPLES:
- examples/similar_feature.py - This is almost exactly what I want
```

#### Issue: "Documentation fetch failed"
**Symptoms**:
- Web fetch errors during generation
- Missing API documentation

**Solution**:
1. Save documentation locally
```bash
mkdir -p docs/external
wget https://api.example.com/docs -O docs/external/api.html
```

2. Reference local file
```markdown
DOCUMENTATION:
- file: docs/external/api.html
  why: API reference for integration
```

### 2. Execution Failures

#### Issue: "Validation keeps failing"
**Symptoms**:
- Same errors after multiple attempts
- AI can't fix linting issues

**Solution**:
1. Run validation manually
```bash
./scripts/validate.sh --verbose
```

2. Check for environment issues
```bash
# Ensure tools are installed
pip install ruff mypy pytest
```

3. Simplify the PRP
- Break into smaller tasks
- Remove complex validations temporarily

### Integration Points
```yaml
DOCUMENTATION_INTEGRATION:
  - enhances: README.md
  - supports: New users and AI assistants
  - enables: Self-service troubleshooting
  
NAVIGATION:
  - docs/: Organized by topic
  - Cross-references: Link between related docs
  - Search-friendly: Clear headings and keywords
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Documentation Structure
```bash
# Verify all planned files exist
find docs -name "*.md" | wc -l
# Expected: 15+ documentation files

# Check for broken links
grep -r "](/" docs/ | grep -v "http"
# Should reference valid paths
```

### Level 2: Content Quality
```python
def test_documentation_completeness():
    '''Ensure documentation covers key topics.'''
    
    required_sections = {
        'docs/getting-started.md': ['Prerequisites', 'Step 1', 'Your First'],
        'docs/best-practices.md': ['INITIAL.md', 'Examples', 'PRP Quality'],
        'docs/troubleshooting.md': ['Common Issues', 'Solutions', 'Debug']
    }
    
    for doc, sections in required_sections.items():
        with open(doc, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            for section in sections:
                assert section in content, f"{section} missing from {doc}"

def test_examples_runnable():
    '''Documentation code examples are valid.'''
    import ast
    import re
    
    # Extract Python code blocks
    for doc in Path('docs').rglob('*.md'):
        with open(doc, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            
        # Find Python code blocks
        code_blocks = re.findall(r'```python\n(.*?)\n```', content, re.DOTALL)
        
        for code in code_blocks:
            try:
                ast.parse(code)
            except SyntaxError:
                # Some blocks might be partial - that's OK
                pass
```

### Level 3: Diagram Rendering
```bash
# Test Mermaid diagrams
for diagram in docs/diagrams/*.mermaid; do
  echo "Checking $diagram"
  # Verify basic Mermaid syntax
  grep -E "graph|flowchart|sequenceDiagram" "$diagram"
done
```
